# Matching-Strings
PIET's CS Department is writing a spell-checker system, and you have been tasked with writing a function to determine how closely two words resemble each other. The algorithm you are to use, albeit not a very good one, is to compare the two words character by character, and count how many times the characters in a given position are the same.  For instance, the words "TICK" and "TOCK" have a score of 3, since three characters (T, C, K) are the same.  Similarly, "CAT" and "DOG" score 0, since no letters match.  You are given Strings A and B and you have to return an integer K indicating the score (as defined above) of how closely the two match.  Input :  First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input, where first line contains the string A and second line contains the string B.  Output :  For each test case print the score on a line.  Constraints :  A and B will each contain between 1 and 500 characters, inclusive. Each character of a and b will be 'A'-'Z'. 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50   # Sample Input(Plaintext Link)  4 TICK TOCK CAT DOG APPLE APPLES 	 FANTASTIC ANTASTIC # Sample Output(Plaintext Link)  3 0 5 0
